"""
bhch09exrc08.py: The GCD (greatest common divisor) of two numbers is the largest number that both are divisible by. For instance, gcd(18, 42) is 6 because the largest number that both 18 and 42 are divisible by is 6. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and computes their gcd. Shown below is a way to compute the GCD, called Euclidâ€™s Algorithm.

- First compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number.
- Next, replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
- Repeat this process until the smaller number is 0. The GCD is the last value of the larger number.
