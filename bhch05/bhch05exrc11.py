"""
@@@@ Program Statement:
Write a program that computes the factorial of a number. The factorial, 
n!, of a number n is the product of all the integers between 1 and n, 
including n. For instance, 5! = 1 路 2 路 3 路 4 路 5 = 120.
[Hint: Try using a multiplicative equivalent of the summing technique.]

number = eval(input('Enter a number: '))

fact = 1
for i in range(number, 1, -1):
	fact = fact * i

print('Factorial of', number, 'is', fact)
