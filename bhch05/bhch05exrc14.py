@@@@ Program statement: bhch05exrc14.py
This exercise is about the well-known Monty Hall problem. In the problem, 
you are a contestant on a game show. The host, Monty Hall, shows you 
three doors. Behind one of those doors is a prize, and behind the other 
two doors are goats. You pick a door. Monty Hall, who knows behind 
which door the prize lies, then opens up one of the doors that doesnâ€™t 
contain the prize. There are now two doors left, and Monty gives you 
the opportunity to change your choice. Should you keep the same door, 
change doors, or does it not matter?  
(a) Write a program that simulates playing this game 10000 times and 
calculates what percentage of the time you would win if you switch and 
what percentage of the time you would win by not switching.  
(b) Try the above but with four doors instead of three. There is still 
only one prize, and Monty still opens up one door and then gives you 
the opportunity to switch.
