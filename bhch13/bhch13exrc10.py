"""
bhch13exrc10.py: Write a function called closest that takes a list of numbers L and a number n and returns the largest element in L that is not larger than n. For instance, if L=[1,6,3,9,11] and n=8, then the function should return 6, because 6 is the closest thing in L to 8 that is not larger than 8. Donâ€™t worry about if all of the things in L are smaller than n.
