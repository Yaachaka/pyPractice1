bhch08exrc04.py: (a) Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence and then randomly rearranges the words of the sentence. Donâ€™t worry about getting punctuation or capitalization correct.
(b) Do the above problem, but now make sure that the sentence starts with a capital, that the original first word is not capitalized if it comes in the middle of the sentence, and that the period is in the right place.
